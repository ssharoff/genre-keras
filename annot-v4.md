A text is expected to have a **Strongly** annotation for at least one principal dimension. More than one **Strongly** is possible for some texts, but each choice needs to be justified by how similar a text is to the prototypical genres indicated with the test question.

# Comments on individual functions
+ A1 Argumentative texts :: Their main function is to argue, usually in favour of a particular viewpoint.  At the same time, many texts are writted with the intention to persuade the reader.  Since in applying a functional typology we want to distinguish between different kinds of texts, the A1 `Argumentation' function is judged by its similarity to such texts as newspaper editorials or discussion forums, while other kinds of argumentation, such as academic articles or reviews, are treated as having more specific functions and are not assigned to A1.
+ A4 Fiction :: Usually the aim is to create a story to entertain the reader or to provoke their imagination.  Occasionally there can be confusion with A11 `Personal reporting' when it is not clear to what extent the story is just a faithful depiction of events in someone's life.  In this case, both functions can be appropriate.  Usually the aim of entertaining the reader with a fictional story includes embellishments, such as humour or mood setting scenes.  They are unlikely in Personal reporting.
+ A7 Instructional texts :: Occasionally they can be hybrids with A11 `Personal reporting' (/I report how I solved a problem/) or A16 `Reference information' (background information is combined with advice).
+ A8 News reporting :: Not all kinds of newspaper articles contain informative reporting.  Some of them are aimed argumentation or propaganda.  In judging a text as A8 we need to detect its similarity with informative reporting such as newswires (/what happened where/).  Information about future events can be considered A8 too.  Often news outlets provide lists of links, which consist of headings of genuine news reporting articles, so this is also A8.
+ A9 Legal regulatory texts :: `Legal' should *not* be considered as a topic here.  A newspaper report from the court is not legal in the sense of its function as regulations.  A summary of regulations is also A9 (it can be a hybrid with A7 or A16 depending on the function).
+ A11 Personal reporting :: On the Web, these are primarily posts about events in someone's life reported from the first person viewpoint, such as personal diary blogs.  In the past, published diaries or memoirs served similar function.  Interviews telling about someone's life are another example of this function.  A personal A11 story can be a hibrid with other functions, such as A1 Argumentation or A17 Review.
+ A12 Promotional texts :: Common examples of texts with this function are descriptions of goods from Web shops or presentations of how wonderful a item for purchase is.  Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish commercial promotion from faithful positive reviews (A17), in which case both functions can be appropriate.
+ A14 Academic writing :: The main aim of such texts is to disseminate new academic research, which is different from providing reference information (A16) or giving advice (A7), though there can be hybrid texts.
+ A16 Reference information :: The assumption is that information is provided from a neutral point of view.  Test whether this text is publishable in Wikipedia.  Occasionally, informative texts in A16 include A1 Argumentation as their secondary function.
+ A17 Review :: Many texts evaluate something, but that's not the intended purpose of this functional dimension. In applying A17, test how similar your text is to typical prototype reviews from Amazon or Tripadvisor.
+ A20 Apellative texts :: These texts requests an action from the reader.  Given that there is a separate category of overtly promotional texts (A12), it's better to annotate plain advertising (requests to buy) as A12.  Similarly, informative questions, such as those in StackExchange even without answers, have a more suitable function of A7, while the A20 category here is primarily for genuine requests.  A20 can be occasionally a hybrid category with Reference information (A16) to provide background information, such as a job description.
